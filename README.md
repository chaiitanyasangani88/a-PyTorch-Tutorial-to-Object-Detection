This codebase is forked from this [amazing repo](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection)

Trained a neural network to find compliance with social distancing. Training dataset is taken from [here](https://megapixels.cc/oxford_town_centre/)

`extract_frames` and `extract_gt` used for preparing the dataset into required format. Added Tensorboard support.
